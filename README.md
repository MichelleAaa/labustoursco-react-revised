## Reflection 

This project was built primarily while I was studying in the Nucamp Full Stack Web and Mobile Application Development Bootcamp, during the React course. Initially I built this website during the Bootstrap course as an HTML-based website. In the React course, it was advised for us to convert our projects into React so we could focus on learning how to work with components and JSX.

While implementing this project I ran into several challenges. One of the challenges was learning how data flows through components (aka through props) and how to use hooks. Another challenge was finding that some of the bootstrap code broke on conversion, so I added in Reactstrap to get the model component to work. Additionally, the lack of being able to use internal page links took some time to resolve, and ultimately ended in the installation of react-scrollchor to fix the problem. Overall, this project was a great learning experience.
